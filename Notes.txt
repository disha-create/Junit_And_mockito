JUnit

1) A software test is a piece of software which executes another piece of software.
2) It validates if the code results in the expected state
3) Unit Testing is categorized in Behavior and state testing
	a) Behavior:- Check if the method is called with proper arguments				
	b) State:- After the method is called what will be the state.
4) A Unit can be a small piece of an application which can be -> method or a class.
5) A software regression is a bug which makes your feature of application stop functioning.
6) A software performance regression is a situation where code works perfectly but performance is slow or resource consumption is too high.

Testing terminologies:
1) Code -> (Application under test)
	The code which is tested is called as as code under test
2) Test Fixture:
	Its a fixed state of a set of objects which are used as a baseline for running the tests
3) Unit test:
	Is a piece of code written by the developer that executes specific functionality and asserts 
the behavior and state.
4) Performance Testing:
	It allows to check the performance of your application
5) Integration Testing:
6) Behavior Testing:


Tesing Frameworks:	JUnit and TestNG. (Popular once)

* JUnit is open source designed for writing and running tests in Java.
* Originally written by Erich Gama and Kent Beck.
* Unit testing framework, available in jar file
* Can be executed from command prompt or IDE.


Assertion methods:

1) fail(String)
2) assertTrue(boolean) : the function must return true
3) assertFalse(boolean) : the function must return false
4) assertNull(message, object) : we are expecting the object to be null.
5) assertNotNull() : we are expecting the object should not be null.
6) assertEquals(actual, expected)
	if you campare two objects using assertEquals then the equality is based on the equals method
	hence you must override the method.
